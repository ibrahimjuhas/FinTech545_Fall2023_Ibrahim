#Project Week 05

Git clone the repo
Run all the cells in Jupyter notebook.

The dailyreturn.csv, portfolio.csv, and dailyprices.csv are sourced from local directory. Please change the directory to the raw link from github. The data sources are uploaded to GitHub. 

If not,change the directory on pd.read_csv('') from GitHub location to local directory where data sources are downloaded
If you get an error on missing packages, please install them.


There is a folder called library that includes all the functions for problem 2. When calling those functions for testing or for problem 3, please make sure they are in the same directory as the ipynb file. Otherwise, when importing the functions, please make sure the directory is used. For instance,
Import Library/'function_name', instead of import 'function_name'. This is not required if the functions are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook file.
